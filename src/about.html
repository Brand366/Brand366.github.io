                <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
                <p>I have always had a keen interest in the world of programming, and recently
                    started my journey down
                    the path of learning about the many applications of programming and how it can be used creatively
                    with Coder Academy in the Code, Cloud & Cyber-security bootcamp course.
                    When I'm not engrossed in programming and the such, I'm usually working out, hiking all around, and
                    hanging out with my son (not particularly in that order &#128516).
                    I have luckily
                    travelled to New Zealand and hiked a plenty while I was there but unfortunately didn't go to the
                    Shire. I also have travelled to Japan and explored the beautiful cities of Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka.

                <h2>What I Have Done With Programming (So far...)</h2>
                <p> I intially started my path in programming by attending a online course through a company called
                    Udacity. The course itself was called "Intro to Programming Nanodegree" and it gave me a good
                    foundation in HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. It even gave me insight into navigating the shell
                    and using GitHub for projects. I then completed two Data Science courses online through another
                    company called edX. Those courses were an introduction into the field and utilized Python for
                    gathering, parsing, and presenting data.

                <h2>Goals with Programming</h2>
                <p>My current goal in regards to programming is to become a full-fledged,
                    full-stack
                    developer. Whether
                    that is with a particluar company or free lancing on my own, I hope to dicover what area in
                    particluar interests me and in what way I can use programming to help people in any way that is
                    possible. If it interests you though, you can find my resume below for a run-down of my work
                    experience and education:</p>
