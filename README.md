Above is the repository that I used for the website.

# My Portfolio

## Purpose: 

To begin with my portfolio website is designed to represent and communicate my qualities, aspirations, achievements and other general information about me. It contains 4 main pages which include the home/index, about, blog, and contact. The blog landing page also includes image links to 5 blog posts as sub-child pages.

## Target Audience:

The target audience is an employer looking to engage a dev and/or IT professional. The employer will typically possess technical knowledge in regards to information technology, software development/coding, programming languages and development stacks. Will also possess high expectations of professionalism and a positive work ethic.


## Functionality & Features:

### Sitemap:

The following is the sitemap image used for the website layout: ![sitemap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74232016/121772313-05672980-cbb8-11eb-8d64-0ed0187bc1b7.png)


### Site Theme & Design:

I adopted a minimilistic design for the website, using dark contrast colours mainling for the theme. It also included easy to read fonts. The site was implemented in a way where it can be altered later on, easily navigated, and to be responsive across a multitude of devices.


### Tech Stack:

The technologies that were utilized in the making of this website include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP & AJAX. The PHP & AJAX will be fully implemented at a later date and will be used primarily for the contact form and possibly other forms. The website was created in the VS Code enviroment as well. I also utilized GitHub to push changes to the site, to the repository to keep track of iterations & delpoyment. In addition, a xml sitemap is utilized & an SRI for secuirty purposes, to prevent malicious tampering and to prove my ownership of the website.  

### Universal Components:

A responsive header element with a nav bar element and logo is used for all devices. A responisve footer element is also implemented for all devices, this includes a copyright notice and links (a tags) to GitHub, LinkedIn, and email accounts. All containers and text outside of containers have a shadow effect & possess a drop down effect when the page loads. Across all pages of the site articles, sections, divs, images, links (a tags), figures, and a form were used in regards to semantic HTML. This was accompanied by CSS for styling, and a bit of JQuery for the nav bar.  

### Home/Index Page: 

To expand upon the aforementioned pages that are included in the portfolio, the home/index incldues a small intro of me and that I am studying to be a DevOps Engineer that specializes in *coding*, *cloud*, & *cyber*. This is accompanied by 3 images for the specializations which is displayed side by side in the center of the page for desktop. In response to device usage, the content of the page forms a single column when accessed by mobile, tablet, and/or small laptops. The following is an image of the home landing page: ![homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74232016/121771764-c71c3b00-cbb4-11eb-9633-35afedf6a0c0.png)

### About Page:

The About page contains an image of me and my name located under. The image and text also have a animation where it expands when hovering over it with the cursor. There is three containers spaced evenly with flexbox. These containers have information about me, what education I have completed in regards to programmig & my goals with programming. This page also contains a link to my resume for further information in regards to education & work expirience. The "A Bit About Me" also contains an emoji. These sections are displayed side-by-side in the center of the page with image and image text are displayed above. In response to device usage, the content of the page forms a single column when accessed by mobile, tablet, and/or small laptops. The following is an image of the about page of the site: ![aboutpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74232016/121772351-3c3d3f80-cbb8-11eb-992e-e2d1a2bb069d.png)

### Blog Landing Page:

This page included a page introduction and description at the top the page, this is followed by 5 containers for the blog post information. These containers are manipulated by flex box to displayed in a row, filling the screen by three containers at a time and then wrapping the excess to the next row and so on. Each container contains a heading, image, publish date for the blog post itself, and a short blurb about the content. The image funtions as a link to the blog post itself. The containers for smaller devices form into a sinlge column layout for accessibility for those users. The following is the image of the blog post landing page: ![bloglandingpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74232016/121772460-cc7b8480-cbb8-11eb-84ef-b18ed13f942b.png)
  

### Blog Post Page:

The design for the blog post page is similar to the containers located in the blog landing page. The blog container itself is upscaled with the correct dimensions, to the page with the same layout as shown in the landing page. In addition to this, located at the bottom of the blog and page itself is a button to navigate back to the top of the page, a previous button to acccess the previous page (the button functions as the same the back-to-top button when it is the first blog post, this will be changed in further iterations), and finally the next button which takes the user to the next blog post and fuctions the same as the previous button. All of the blog post pages are the exact same, with exception of the blog content itself. The following is the image of the page itself: ![blogpostpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74232016/121772643-f7b2a380-cbb9-11eb-92ca-815b3ecf83c2.png)
 

### Contact Page:

The contact page contains two containers. On desktop, they are layed out side-by-side using floats, margins, and paddings. There was no particular reason for this, as I just wanted to try different styling methods. Although, they styled similarly to the rest of the website. The two containers are displayed side-by-side with the contact information on the left. This container has my phone number, email address, and links to my GitHub & LinkedIn accounts. While the right most container is the contact form for users to input their name, email address, and a short message to be submitted via a mailto: button at the bottom of the form. This is where I wanted to implement PHP & AJAX scripts for serverside use & to help facilitate the message to be sent correctly without being taken outside of the site to the users default email program. This will be rectified in futher iterations as well. For smaller devices, the containers form into a single column layout, with the contact information container at the top for readability. The following is a screenshot the page itself: ![contactpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74232016/121772929-fbdfc080-cbbb-11eb-85fe-2db59f7babb8.png)
